          <p>My name is Chase McFaddin. I am a software developer originally from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. I’ve recently moved out to Washington state to begin making a transition from over a decade long sales career. My career goal in software development is to work for a company that provides great service(s) to their customers, employees, and local communities. </p>

          <p>My name is Kyle Atkinson, I spent four years in the Navy as a boatswain's mate. I separated honorably and
            got into commercial diving. The diving industry started slowing due to COVID-19 so I am now going to Code
            Fellows to become a software engineer.</p>

            My name is Scott Falbo.  I'm a Software Developer based out of Seattle, WA.  Coming from a twenty year long career as a professional tattoo artist I've spent my entire adult life interacting with and creating custom designs for clients all coming from a vast array of backgrounds. I'm excited to transfuse that experience, as well my aptitude for creating, and extensive art background, into building functional, accessible and engaging software.
